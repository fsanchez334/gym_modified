Purpose: Imagine a gymnasium in which every visitor is required to sign in and indicate the number of the treadmill the person wants to use. While a piece of paper seems to be the easy way to do that, it may be unreliable. Sometimes a person may not even use the treadmill for the full amount of time, or people use a treadmill logged and assigned to another person. This program aims to resolve such hypothethical issue by taking in a user's ID and assinging it a treadmill. After doing so, the program outputs the treadmills that are available. If no treadmill is available, that will be known to the user, and the user will be placed in a line, which will be represented as a Deque in the program. It is also worth noting that the program will charge a fee for every minute past the alloted time requested by the user. In retrospect, it can serve as a deterrent for hoarding gym equipment for an extended period of time. 

This is still a project in the works.
