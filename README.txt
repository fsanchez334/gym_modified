Purpose: Imagine a gymnasium in which every visitor must sign in and indicate the treadmill the person wants to use. While a piece of paper seems to be the easy way to log that information, it's an obsolete method. Sometimes a person may not even use the treadmill for the full amount of time, or people use a treadmill logged and assigned to another person. In other words, the information on a piece of paper is not amendable or representative of the gym-equipment reservations in real-time. Why continue with this method when a reliable program can give you that information at ease?

My program aims to resolve such a hypothetical issue by taking in a user's ID and giving it a treadmill. It is a useful feature because if someone wants to use the same treadmills, the program will let the visitor know that such equipment is not available.  If none is available, the program notifies the user and will place the user on hold. It is also worth noting that the program will charge a fee for every minute past the user's allotted time. In retrospect, it can serve as a deterrent for hoarding gym equipment for an extended period.

This is still a project in the works.
