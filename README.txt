Purpose: Imagine a gymnasium in which every visitor must sign in and indicate the treadmill the person wants to use. While a piece of paper seems to be the easy way to log that information, it's an obsolete method. Sometimes a person may not even use the treadmill for the full amount of time, or people use a treadmill logged and assigned to another person. In other words, the information on a piece of paper is not amendable or representative of the gym-equipment reservations in real-time. Why continue with this method when a reliable program can give you that information at ease?

My program aims to resolve such a hypothetical issue by taking in a user's ID and giving it a treadmill. It is a useful feature because if someone wants to use the same treadmills, the program will let the visitor know that such equipment is not available.  If none is available, the program notifies the user and will place the user on hold. It is also worth noting that the program will charge a fee for every minute past the user's allotted time. In retrospect, it can serve as a deterrent for hoarding gym equipment for an extended period.

Update:
Phase One Completion:
{September 14, 2020}
	The program has reached the completion of its Phase One. In this phase, the program is at a basic level intended to log the treadmills' information, including its operating. Currently, the computer program asks for the number of people who will be using the treadmills. Afterward, the program allocates memory for twice the amount of treadmills than the number of people going to the gym. The program asks the user's personal information such as name, birthday, and class year. From there, the program prompts the user to give the number of the treadmill they would want to use - the program then reserves that treadmill with the person's information. After each user commits tp their treadmill, the program outputs the treadmills list, outlining which ones are available.

Prospects for Phase Two:
	In this phase, I hope that I can create exceptions unique to the class. For instance, I want to make sure that the person is not trying to reserve a taken treadmill - the program will give the user a warning. Moreover, I want to implement a timer that will track the amount of time a user spends on a treadmill and store the number of minutes.  Afterward, the program determines if it should charge the user for using the machine beyond the allotted time. By saying this, I then need to include code that asks for how many minutes the user will be using the treadmill.
